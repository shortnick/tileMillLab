===========
parts one and two. part 3 was not worth the difficulty of excavating old data and teaching myself another platform

Second set - a shapfile of WA railroads layered over state/country lines, plus urban areas from included urban areas

Rails layer: styled with contrasting color and crosshatching, labels for certain lengths of track at certain zoom levels, also modulated labelling to less than 25 degree tilt
-- tool tip highlighting shows modified column headers and values about track section (including owner and status) 

Urban areas: styled to a color unobtrusive vs. background and rather transparent.  Used labels: smaller cities visible at higher zoom, halo effect to make them more legible in general
